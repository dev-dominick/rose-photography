          Hi Everyone! Welcome to Rose Photography..
          where life's precious moments are caught by a lens.
          I am new to the photography world in that I am a full-time
          registered nurse. Nursing is something I've loved for a very
          long time and have been blessed to be doing it for the last 5 years.
          I am a fur-mommy to 7 beautiful kitty cats and 4 incredible doggies
          who all bring so much joy and love into my life. I am big on being
          with family, constantly being with and doing things with my parents,
          sisters, niece and nephews, and friends who are more like family.
        </p>
        <p id='statement2'>
          I have always been passionate about photography, constantly
          being the photographer for many family and friend events without
          even realizing it. Now is my chance to professionally bring to life
          people's most sacred moments. I know the importance of having
          pictures and what they could mean for years to come. It would be
          my absolute pleasure to capture these moments in the most fun and
          positive way for all!
